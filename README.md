# 🔍 web-search-plus-plugin

**Multi-provider web search as a native OpenClaw tool.**

A standalone OpenClaw plugin that registers `web_search_plus` as a first-class tool with intelligent auto-routing. No skill dependency needed — install, configure, and go.

## ✨ Features

- **Intelligent auto-routing** — analyzes query intent and picks the best provider automatically
- **6 search providers** — use one or all, graceful fallback if any is down
- **Local result caching** — saves API costs on repeated queries
- **Interactive setup wizard** — guided configuration via `python3 scripts/setup.py`
- **Native OpenClaw tool** — registers as `web_search_plus`, not a skill

## 🔎 Supported Providers

| Provider | Best for | Free tier |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Serper** (Google) | Facts, news, shopping, local businesses | 2,500 queries/month |
| **Tavily** | Deep research, analysis, explanations | 1,000 queries/month |
| **Exa** (Neural) | Semantic discovery, finding similar content | 1,000 queries/month |
| **Perplexity** | AI-synthesized answers with citations | Via API key |
| **You.com** | Real-time RAG, LLM-ready snippets | Limited free tier |
| **SearXNG** | Privacy-first, self-hosted, $0 cost | Free (self-hosted) |

## 🧠 Auto-Routing Examples

The plugin analyzes your query and picks the best provider:

| Query | Routed to | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| "iPhone 16 Pro price" | Serper | Shopping intent detected |
| "how does TCP/IP work" | Tavily | Research/explanation intent |
| "companies like Stripe" | Exa | Discovery/semantic intent |
| "what is quantum computing" | Perplexity | Direct answer intent |
| "latest news AI regulation" | Serper | News intent |

You can always override with `provider: "tavily"` (or any other) to force a specific provider.

## 🛠️ Tool Parameters

The registered `web_search_plus` tool accepts:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | ✅ | Search query |
| `provider` | string | ❌ | Force a provider: `serper`, `tavily`, `exa`, `perplexity`, `you`, `searxng`, or `auto` (default) |
| `count` | number | ❌ | Number of results (default: 5) |

## 🧪 Test Directly

You can test the search script standalone:

```bash
# Auto-route
python3 scripts/search.py -q "your query here"

# Force a specific provider
python3 scripts/search.py -q "your query" -p tavily

# More results
python3 scripts/search.py -q "your query" --max-results 10
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need all 6 providers?
No. The plugin works with just one API key. Configure whichever providers you have — the auto-router will use what's available and skip what's not.

### What's the difference between this plugin and the `web-search-plus` skill?
The **plugin** registers a native tool that any agent can use directly. The **skill** provides a SKILL.md with instructions for the agent. Both use the same search backend. Use the plugin for cleaner integration — it's the recommended approach.

### Do I need Python?
Yes, Python 3 is required. The search logic runs as a Python script. Most Linux servers and macOS have Python 3 pre-installed.

### How does auto-routing work?
The router scores each provider based on query signals — keywords like "price" or "buy" boost Serper, research-oriented queries boost Tavily, semantic/discovery queries boost Exa, and direct questions boost Perplexity. The highest-scoring provider wins.

### Does it cache results?
Yes. Results are cached locally in a `.cache/` directory inside the plugin folder. Identical queries return cached results instantly and don't consume API credits. Cache is file-based and survives restarts.

### Can I use Perplexity through Kilo Gateway?
Yes. Set `KILOCODE_API_KEY` in your `.env` — the plugin routes Perplexity requests through the Kilo Gateway automatically. You can also use a direct `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`.

### What about SearXNG?
SearXNG is a self-hosted meta search engine that aggregates 70+ sources. It's free but requires your own instance. The plugin validates the instance URL on setup and includes SSRF protection for security.

### Does it work in sandboxed agents?
Yes, as long as the tool is allowed in the agent's tool config. The plugin runs on the host alongside the gateway.

## 📋 Requirements

- **OpenClaw** gateway (any recent version)
